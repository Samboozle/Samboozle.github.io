export default `Recovering musician, recoving gamer, and recovering son of a 
                Perl programmer, new San Diegan Samuel Bates is seeking similarly
                disciplined developers and mentors for mutual and ongoing
                enrichment. An enthusiastic fledgling in React and Rails,
                Samuel, through his pursuit of polyglottism (and pedantry), is
                well-suited to environments that demand rapid acquisition
                of new languages, libraries, and frameworks. Samuel graduated
                from the University of Oregon in June of 2019 with a degree in 
                music and a minor in "I should really learn to program."
                \nAnd so he has.\n`
